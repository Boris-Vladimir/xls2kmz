@python version:
    Python 3.4

@summary:
    Control composed by the XlsControl() class, which reads data from
    an EXEL file and return them in a form of a list.
    The class has two public functions:
        - __init__(file_name),
        - read_exel().

@note:
    function __init__(file_name):
        Class constructor.
        Take as parameters the name of the EXEL file.

    function read_exel():
        Reads the names of the EXEL sheets and append them to a list.
        Then, reads all the cells from that sheets and append their
        values to another list.
        At last, returns a list which combines the sheet names and the
        cell values.

@version:
    1.0 (14/11/2013):
        - Creation of the function abrir_exel(ficheiro)

    1.1 (18/11/2013):
        - Implementation of the XlsControl() class.
        - Update of the abrir_exel() function, which is now named
            read_exel():
            - The EXEL cell values to append to the list, are now
              formated according they are Unicode, ints, floats or
              EXEL datetime values.

    1.2 (06/12/2013):
        - Translation of all comments to english and limitation of the
          maximum line lenght. Following the rules of the PEP 8,
          Style Guide for Python Code, writed by Guido van Rossum,
          Barry Warsaw and Nick Coghlan:
            - "Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please
              write your comments in English, unless you are 120 per
              cent sure that the code will never be read by people who
              don't speak your language."
            - "Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. For
              flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural
              restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length
              should be limited to 72 characters."
        - Changed the python version to 3.3

    1.3 (09/04/2014):
        - Added a call to the new class FistRowChecker() which breaks the
            program if the first four columns of the Excel file aren't
                - latitude
                - longitude
                - name
                - description

    1.4 (01/12/2014):
        - Added a check for datetime type in excel cell. Get an error if
            the value is superior to 24:00:00
